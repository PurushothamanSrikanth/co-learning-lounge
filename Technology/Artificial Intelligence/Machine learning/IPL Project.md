Thanks for showing interest in taking part in our Co-learning activity. We assure you the journey full of learning by working on live sports analytics project. To get into the Data Science field, the first and the last thing you need is the portfolio where you have solved a problem using data science. Ask any good Data Scientist and they will tell you the same.

#### <div align="center">“Let’s put theory into practice”</div>
  

In this project, we will create statistical solution for predicting fantasy team for each and every cricket match. This project is live project being tested on IPL 2021.

#### **Why to test on IPL series?**
Any solution needs to be tested well before deployment. Here we are trying to create a solution to predict fantasy team for cricket matches irrespective of toyrnament. This would help users to minimize their loss probability. IPL is one of the most loved competitive form of cricket tournament. It has a mix of players from various nations coming to play together, this makes it even more competitive in every sense. IPL is an annual series and thus ideally suited for testing of this live project. A perfect use case is already in hand, we just need to use it wisely :)

# <div align="center">Project Plan</div>

## <div align="center"><ins>Step wise project execution plan</ins></div>

*Goal of this project is to achieve an accuracy of more than 8 players prediction in Fanstasy team for IPL 2021 batches.*

<U> How to achieve higher prediction accuracy? : </U>

1. Analyze the data and decide on segregation factors.
2. Approach to accomodate all rounder in the process.
3. Consideration for venue and other external factors.
4. Analysis of any other important series which can add value for new players and uncapped players assesment.
5. Prepare statistical approach for player selection considering all above factors.
6. Add head to head player statistics to above match to add intutive insighth in terms of data.
7. Test the above model on previous matches played by creating team as per dreams 11 point system.
8. Try out Monte Carlo simulator or any other technique to improve accuracy.
9. Test it on ongoing IPL 2021 matches by creaing your own dream team based on model.
10. Tweak the model as per requirement to achieve as high accuracy as possible (benchmark accuracy is 8 players).
11. Preparing a process document and business report to be submitted along with code at the completion of project.

## <div align="center"><ins>Project Details</ins></div>

*For enrollment into live project a one on one discussion session would be scheduled with our team where our team will understand your aspiration for joining this project and your understanding about field of Data Science and Cricket.*

**Mentor driven project**

*Mentor would have alternate day check-in to keep track of the progress and also discuss approach taken by the team. Since, this is time bound project thus a team of 4 each would be created who all will have a designated task and need to co-ordinate for task completion.*

**Team task**

*Approach would be discussed along with mentor and same needs to be implemented in stipulated timeframe in co-ordination with other team members. Time commitment is the key to success for this project completion.*

The whole idea is to mentor and guide you well in this learning journey. Like others, we don't want to give you **False hopes** and then fail at making a successful career transition. Also, once you join this live project and after finishing you can showcase this in your profile and apply with sports analytics company as well scale the same approach for other sports as well.

## <div align="center"><ins>Possible data that would give an edge</ins></div>

*Right data is essence but selection of right data happens only with proper analysis. Datasets ahve been collated by our team to make this process easier for all the participants.Datasets collected are keeping in mind below points:*

1. All IPL season data matchwise.
2. Ball by Ball delivery data for all IPL matches.
3. Venue details for all matches along with scorecard.
4. Bowling style deatils for bowlers and all rounders.
5. Other 20-20 format series details.
6. Recent and career statistics performance of all players.

## <div align="center"><ins>Exploratory Data Analysis</ins></div>

*To delve into Data Science, the first step is to identify and analyze our dataset in order to ascertain  different patterns, detect missing values and anomalies and identify different characteristics of our data. In other words, we attempt to understand what the data is trying to tell us.*

<U>Analyze the data based on different aspects :</U>

1. Categorise players based on their strength.
2. Categorise venues based on pitch and boundary capability.
3. Come up with new features based on game format like hard hiiting capability, Short per Index, etc.
4. Categorize players based on Dreams 11 point system.
5. Analyze fitness level of player based on recent and career statistics.
6. Analyze player to player combination.
7. Analyze toss winning aspect for team and player as well to asses the performance.
8. Segreate the players who behave like an outlier or for whom performance pattern can't be detected.

## <div align="center"><ins>Dataset split- (1 hour)</ins></div>

*It is a common practice in machine learning to split data into training, testing and validation set allowing us to calibrate our model and test it’s performance on unseen data*

<U> Learn the concepts and significance of data splitting in model development : </U>

1. Train
2. Test
3. Validation (different types) 

## <div align="center"><ins>ML Algorithms- Supervised learning- Regression (6-8 hours)</ins></div>

*Understanding the theoretical and mathematical of machine learning algorithms is the crux of developing accurate predictive models for Regression problem. Different machine learning algorithms are suited for different types and distribution of data*

<U> Delve into the intricacies of the mathematics and mechanism of the functioning of these algorithms: </U>

   1. Linear Regression
   2. Decision Tree Regressor
   3. Ridge Regression
   4. Lasso Regression
   5. Support Vector Regressor
   6. Artificial Neural Network Regressor
    
## <div align="center"><ins>Evaluation metrics (1 hours)</ins></div>

*A developed model needs to be evaluated for it’s performance before being actually deployed in real time environment.*

<U> Learn the concepts to measure the performance of model based on several metrics : </U>

1. Mean Square Error
2. Root Mean Square Error
3. Mean Absolute Error
4. Mean Absolute Percentage Error

## <div align="center"><ins>ML Explainability (3-4 hours)</ins></div>

*Towards a better understanding of why machine learning models make the decisions they do, and why it matters*

<U> Learn the concepts to measure the interpretability of the ML models : </U>

1. LIME
2. Algorithimc Generalisation

## <div align="center"><ins>Hyperparameter tuning (2-3 hours)</ins></div>

*Once a machine learning algorithm has been identified, it is imperative to choose an optimal set of parameters to tune the model to better fit the data. Such parameters can’t be learn’t during the training process and thus requires an expertise for model tuning.*

Develop an intuition to streamline the parameter optimization process.
